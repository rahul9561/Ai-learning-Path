### Week 5–6: Create an AI-Integrated Project

#### Project Idea: AI-Powered Grocery Recommendation System

**Frontend**:
- Use React.js for building user interfaces.

**Backend**:
- Use Node.js with Express.js for API development.

**AI Component**:
- Build a recommendation engine using Python.
  - Algorithm: Collaborative filtering to suggest groceries based on user purchase history.
  - Use Flask or FastAPI to expose the AI model as an API.

**Database**:
- Use MySQL for storing user data and purchase history.

**Deployment**:
- Host the AI model using a cloud service (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
- Deploy the full-stack application using Nginx for production.
